# Tool & Libraries 

In this project, we are going to use Google Colab. It is a development online tool from Google Research. Colab lets any data scientists write and execute python code through the browser. Also, is especially well fit for machine learning, data analysis, and education.  


# Machine learning Algorithm

Our modeling approach will consist of vectorizing the corpus kept in the “text” column, after that, applying TF-IDF [ Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency] , and finally a classification machine learning algorithm. Pretty common in text analytics and NLP.  

The algorithms that will be used and compare between them :   

LogisticRegression()  
Decision Tree Classifier()  
Random Forest Classifier()
